    <title>MoJoeLogic Learning Accountability</title>

<body>
    <h2>New Month. New Plan.</h2> 
    <div class=”publishDate”>August 1st, 2022 </div>

    <p>If you are reading this early on, you may notice that the site is stripped down. As in, it is purely html. I’m at the point that this needs to be my approach overall to learning to be a full-stack developer.</p>
    <p>So hopefully you are into that sort of thing…Or I hopefully went back and made things prettier before you found it.</p>

    <p><strong>My goals for today are:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Read for an hour</li>
            <li>Work on the coding course for at least two hours</li>
            <li>Take a row plus join a colleague’s 100th Peloton ride</li>
            <li>Go on a walk with my wife</li>
            <li>Set this blog up on GitHub Pages adding the MoJoeLogic domain name</li>
            <li>Check in on Dev Related Events to help with</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The overarching theme is to strip back to just implementing coding learned and focusing inward for most of the day.</p>

    <h3>What I’m Currently Studying</h3>

    <p>My current course of study is Codecademy’s Full-stack Engineer Career Path. I started on July 14th when Udemy’s site went down for the second time in a week. My progress is not as high as I would expect of myself at only 12% program completion.</p>

    <p>In looking at how I’ve attempted to learn programming since late May 2021 there are bursts of action followed lulls as significant work is taken on outside of leanring. I am starting these as daily check-ins to help keep skills fresh when I cannot study as much. Or at least provide data points to see what goes wrong if Codecademy doesn’t do the trick.</p>

    <p>So far though the hands on style and text based instruction has maintained my focus better than any of the Udemy or other courses. Hopefully with this program as a foundation, I can move back to some of them for additional reinforcement soon.</p>

    <h3> What I’m Currently Reading</h3>
        <p>My current book selections are <em>HTML&CSS</em> by Jon Duckett and <em>flow</em> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.  Today and likely most of the week I’ll be focusing on the Jon Ducket book to help with the Full-Stack course and building up this site.  To date other than following Udemy tutorials for "mini-sites", my only website experience is through use of Google Sites, Wordpress, and similar products which limit user error and creativity.</p>

    <h3>Exercise for the Day</h3>
    <p>Today should only be rowing and my first day back at it in two months. A colleague posted though that she is doing her 100th cycling session on the Peloton and it is a short 20 minute ride. So I am going to do a little extra today and also still plan to go on a walk if it is not too hot this evening.</p>
    <p>It might be worth creating a separate FitDev subpage at some point with an option to go back and check off that I completed these.</p>

    <h3>Project(s) Updates</h3>
    <p>If you are reading this the GitHub Pages project must have happened. I am considering streaming it. Hopefully the stream worked out too!</p>

    <h3>Mental State</h3>
    <p>I’m starting something new with these daily updates and optimistic that being more habitual about using these skills will help them stick this time. Also I must generally be looking forward to it as I woke at 3am to create an outline of the site and possible video in Google Docs before heading back to bed.</p>

    <h3>Other Random Musings</h3>
    <p>None for today. It just feels good to get a small win up on GitHub.</p>
